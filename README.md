# Linear-Regression-3-way
This project is about implementing a simple Linear Regression Model in three different ways and comparing their solution: 

1. Using Scikit Learn library
2. Ordinary Least Square Solution (Linear Algebra method)
3. Grid Search method


### 1. Using sklearn :
       In this method, we simply use the LinearRegression() model provided in the module sklearn.linear_model. 
       
### 2. Ordinary Least Square Solution (Linear Algebra method):
       In this method we implement the ordinary least square solution from scratch using numpy, to find the beta parameters.
       
### 3. Grid Search method:
        Here, we create a 2x2 grid, calculate the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) and select the best parameters
        based on the minimum SSE value.

## In the END we compare all 3 methods and their Solutions.
